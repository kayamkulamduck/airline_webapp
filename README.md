    # ✈️ Airline Booking Market Demand Web App

This is a Flask-based web app that fetches and displays airline market demand trends. It was built as part of a skill assessment for a Python Developer internship.

---

## 🔍 Features

- ✅ Scrapes real airline route data (via OpenFlights public dataset)
- 📊 Displays demand insights with simulated prices and popularity
- 🎨 Simple, responsive UI with charts and tables
- 🧰 Clean, modular code (scraping, processing, UI)
- 🧪 Easily swappable data sources (can connect to real airline APIs)

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Python 3.12
- Flask
- Pandas
- Plotly.js (for charts)
- HTML + Bootstrap

## ✈️ Sample Output

| Route        | Avg. Price ($) | Demand (%) |
|--------------|----------------|-------------|
| AER → KZN    | 100            | 60%         |
| ASF → KZN    | 101            | 63%         |
| ASF → MRV    | 102            | 66%         |
| CEK → KZN    | 103            | 69%         |
| CEK → OVB    | 104            | 72%         |
| DME → KZN    | 105            | 75%         |
| DME → NBC    | 106            | 78%         |
| DME → TGK    | 107            | 81%         |
| DME → UUA    | 108            | 84%         |
| EGO → KGD    | 109            | 87%         |

This data was generated by fetching real-world route codes from the [OpenFlights dataset](https://openflights.org/data.html).  
Price and demand are simulated for demonstration, and can be swapped with real-time data in production.

## 🤝 Acknowledgements

- [OpenFlights](https://openflights.org/data.html) for real airline route data  
- [BooksToScrape](http://books.toscrape.com) used for early-stage mock scraping during development

## 🧠 Future Enhancements

- Integrate real-time airline APIs (e.g. Skyscanner, Aviationstack)
- Add filters for origin/destination airports, price ranges, date ranges
- Interactive visualizations (e.g. Plotly, Chart.js)
- Deploy as a live web app (e.g. PythonAnywhere, Replit, Render)
- Dockerize for scalable deployment
- Use **OpenFlights data more deeply** (e.g. airline names, airport metadata)
- Track historical trends & generate reports
